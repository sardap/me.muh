# me.muh

A Brainfuck esq language I made in 2016 where everything is me and muhs and numbers

## Compiling 
```./build.sh```

## Using
```./me_muh {INPUT_FILE}```
Note: I had no idea what I was doing so you need to have the input file in the same dir as the "compiler".

## Example
Hello World
```
me muh 77
me me muh 69
me muh muh muh muh muh muh muh
me me muh muh muh muh muh muh muh
me me muh muh muh 37
me me muh muh muh muh muh muh muh
me muh muh muh muh muh muh muh
me muh muh 8
me muh muh muh muh muh muh muh
me muh 72
me muh muh muh muh muh muh muh
```
Don't ask me what each line does this was a long time ago.
