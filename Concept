me stores value muh stores an oprator the way to access a me or muh is by the word count in the line
word	0	1	2	3	4	5	6			7					etc
muh		=	+	-	*	/	%	print	do while 	(LOOPS)

Word	0	1	2	3
Cell	0	0	0	1
	me	muh	muh	me
nor	0	+	1

Word	0	1	2
Cell	0	0	1
	me	muh	me
nor	0	=	1

Word	0	1	2	3	4	5	6
Cell	0	0	1	2	3	4	5
	me	muh	me	me	me	me	me
nor	0	=	5

the way do while works idk
